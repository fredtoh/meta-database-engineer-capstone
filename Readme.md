This repository contains the project files for the final assignment of the Meta Database Engineering Capstone course.

The MySQL Workbench file (`LittleLemonDM.mwb`) is placed at the same directory level as the `Readme.md` file you're currently viewing, i.e. at the base directory of this repository.

Please use `LittleLemonDM.mwb` to recreate the database `littlelemondb` by deploying the forward engineering approach within MySQL Workbench. Please use your username and password accordingly.

In the folder `Week 3 Tasks`, there is a Tableau workbook (`Little Lemon data.twbx`). If you do not have the Tableau Desktop installed, here's a link to access the contents of the workbook online: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/fred.toh/viz/LittleLemonDB/CustomerSalesDashboard.

Thank you very much for checking out my repository.
